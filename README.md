# Project Description
This is a timed quiz about movies that gives you 5 points for each correct answer. Each incorrect answer will lose you 10 seconds.

I was not quite able to get the high score logging to work as expected. If you go through the quiz multiple times, you'll notice high scores start to show up, but they're for the previous attempt, not the current one. 

An initial incomplete attempt was put aside and refactored, but I have included the original code in the folder "Attempt 1" if you'd like to review it.
